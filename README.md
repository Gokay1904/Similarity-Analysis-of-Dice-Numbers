# Similarity-Analysis-of-Dice-Numbers
In libraries such as Matplotlib, Numpy, Seaborn, I developed a model that calculates the similarity ratio of a dice with Monte Carlo simulation (with iterations) and draws its linear regression line.

Here, left section means probability factor in each iteration

Right section means probabilities of similarity.
- By increasing the number of iterations, ratios shift to theoratical results.

Probability Factor:
- 0: if every dice is the same.
- 1: if at least 1 is the same.
- and so on...
